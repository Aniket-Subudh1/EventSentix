# EventSentix

EventSentix is an AI-powered, multichannel sentiment monitoring and real-time issue detection platform designed specifically for events. It enables event organizers to monitor real-time feedback from various channels—including in-app chats, social media (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn), and surveys—while automatically processing and analyzing sentiment, detecting issues, and generating alerts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Sentiment Monitoring & Issue Detection**  
  - Analyze feedback in real time to gauge overall sentiment.
  - Automatically detect issues and escalate alerts if negative sentiment or specific keywords exceed preset thresholds.

- **Multichannel Feedback Integration**  
  - Capture feedback directly via in-app chats and surveys.
  - Integrate with social media channels like Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to import external feedback.
  - Use QR codes for event engagement and to streamline participant feedback.

- **Event Management**  
  - Create, update, and delete events with detailed information (name, description, location, start/end dates).
  - Configure social tracking settings (hashtags, mentions, keywords) for each event.

- **Analytics Dashboard**  
  - Visualize sentiment trends, alert statistics, and feedback breakdowns.
  - Generate detailed reports and export feedback data for post-event analysis.

- **Background Job Processing**  
  - Use Bull (with Redis) to manage asynchronous tasks like sentiment analysis, alert generation, and batch processing.
  - Leverage Socket.IO for real-time updates to dashboards and user interfaces.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Node.js & Express:** Core framework for building a robust RESTful API.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose:** NoSQL database for storing events, feedback, alerts, users, and analytics data.
- **Redis & Bull:** Redis is used as the job store for Bull queues, handling asynchronous feedback processing and alert generation.
- **Socket.IO:** Enables real-time communication between the backend and clients.
- **Passport & JWT:** Provides secure authentication and authorization.
- **Nodemailer:** For sending emails and notifications.
- **Winston:** A powerful logging library for error and activity tracking.
- **NLP Integration:** Integrates with OpenAI and other NLP libraries for sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.

### Frontend
- **React:** For building the interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **React Router:** To handle navigation within the application.
- **Socket.IO Client:** For establishing real-time communication with the backend.
- **QRCode.react:** To generate QR codes for event engagement.
- **Tailwind CSS (or custom CSS):** For styling the application with a modern, responsive design.

## Architecture Overview

EventSentix follows a modular and scalable architecture:

- **API Layer:**  
  RESTful endpoints built with Express handle user authentication, event management, feedback submission, and analytics data retrieval.
  
- **Real-Time Communication:**  
  Socket.IO facilitates real-time updates such as new feedback and alert notifications.
  
- **Background Processing:**  
  Bull queues (backed by Redis) manage intensive background tasks like processing incoming feedback and triggering alerts.
  
- **Data Persistence:**  
  MongoDB (via Mongoose) stores all persistent data, ensuring scalability and flexibility.
  
- **Social Integrations:**  
  Separate services manage the integration with external social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn) for pulling in event-related feedback.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **MongoDB Atlas** or a local MongoDB instance
- **Redis** server
- Set up your environment variables by creating `.env` files in both the backend and frontend directories with the values above.

### Backend Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>/backend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The backend server will run on port `5000` (as specified in your `.env`).

### Frontend Setup
1. **Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:**
   ```bash
   cd <repository_directory>/frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000` and connects to the backend via the specified API and Socket URLs.
